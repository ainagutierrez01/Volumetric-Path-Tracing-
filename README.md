# Volumetric-Path-Tracing-
This project explores volumetric path tracing for rendering participating media such as fog, smoke, and clouds. By extending classical path tracing to support light transport inside volumes, it enables physically based simulation of multiple scattering and realistic volumetric effects, highlighting accuracy–performance trade-offs.
